Got it. Here is a clean `README.md` draft in English that documents your project and learning path:

# Daily Quote

This is a simple web application that displays a random quote of the day. It was created as part of my learning journey by following a tutorial from YouTube and integrating a public quote API.

## Features

- Displays a random quote with its author
- Fetches quotes from an external API
- Option to generate a new quote
- Option to share a quote on Facebook
- Styled with a responsive layout

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## API

This project uses the [Real Inspire API](https://github.com/mohamadayash22/real-inspire):

```

[https://api.realinspire.live/v1/quotes/](https://api.realinspire.live/v1/quotes/)

````

## Learning Source

This project was built by following this tutorial:

[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiUVwPYYT5A&list=PLjwm_8O3suyOgDS_Z8AWbbq3zpCmR-WE9&index=7&t=603s)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yueswater/daily-quote.git
````

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd daily-quote
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Deployment

This project can be deployed using GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider. To ensure that updated CSS and JavaScript files are always loaded, consider appending a version parameter to file references in `index.html`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css?v=1.0.0">
<script src="script.js?v=1.0.0"></script>
```

This technique is called cache busting and helps avoid browser caching issues.

## License

This project is for educational purposes only.

Would you like me to also add a section about the **cache busting problem you solved** (with `?v=123`) as part of your learning journey, so future readers understand why it was needed?
